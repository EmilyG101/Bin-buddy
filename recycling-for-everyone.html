    <h1>♿ Recycling For Everyone</h1>

    <section class="description">
      <p>
        We believe recycling should be accessible to all — including the elderly, disabled, or anyone who has trouble taking out trash and recycling on their own.
        This program connects those who need help with volunteers from our community who hold at least the <strong>Sprout Plan</strong> subscription.
        Volunteers earn bonus points as a thank you for helping neighbors keep our environment clean.
      </p>
      <p>
        Whether you need assistance or want to volunteer, this page helps you get connected and make a difference.
