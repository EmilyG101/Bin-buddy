    <section class="description">
      <p>
        We believe recycling should be accessible to all — including the elderly, disabled, or anyone who has trouble taking out trash and recycling on their own.
        This program connects those who need help with volunteers from our community.
        Volunteers play a vital role in helping neighbors keep our environment clean.
      </p>
      <p>
        Whether you need assistance or want to volunteer, this page helps you get connected and make a difference.
